Secure Conversation System

This is a VERY basic app for encrypting a coversation held between two 
parties. It is NOT for transfering files thats what scp is for. Nor for 
holding confrences.

Maximum message size is 32kb.
There are no passwords required, and there is no way to verify who connects
to a listening scs.

Confirmation of this is left up to you. scs encrypts messages sent by either
part and decrypts them at the other end.

Messages are encrypted by a 256bit AES key, which is itself encrypted by
512bit RSA priv/pub key pairs, the public keys are exchanged at connection.
All keys are randomly generated and not at all human controlable.

Enjoy.
